# When populated, this file is used as copy on the transmission section
# for each artist's biography. It also includes a means of adding social
# media links that basically looks at any unknown attribute and treats
# it as some form of URL. If a proper icon can't be found, a default one
# is used to represent the link text.
#
# Here's an example of a basic artist entry:
#
#   artist_name:
#     bio: A short biography about the artist
#     soundcloud: http://soundcloud.com/artist-name
