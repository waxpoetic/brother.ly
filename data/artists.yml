  biography: "You might know him from his ultra-exclusive parties or his anything-goes DJ sets here in Philadelphia. But perhaps just as long as he's been playing sexy bangers for unrelenting audiences, Michael NightTime has been cooking up electronic productions in a variety of genres. His latest EP on Party Time Society is somewhat of a departure from his earlier work, but retains the playful and care-free vibes of his first two self-released albums."

  biography: "Highly Desirable is a collaboration between Philadelphia Jungle veterans Dick Bagel and Dread Scott (Bubbles). Their particular style of minimal jungle, unlike most of their peers, remains true to Jungle's origins as a music derived from breakbeat samples."

  biography: "A live electro-acoustic band employing real musicians, live theatrics and spontaneous improvisation. Born out of Philadelphia's house music scene and Burner culture, The Wonder Bars are among a new generation of performing artists who have eschewed turntables in favor of playing their special brand of house and garage music with real instruments."
