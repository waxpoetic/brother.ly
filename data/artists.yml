the_wonder_bars: An electronic band from Philadelphia employing real musicians, live theatrics and spontaneous improvisation. Focused on bringing a live element to the EDM culture, The Wonder Bars have been a staple of the Philadelphia underground for the past five years. Their superb musicianship and production work, however, are only being discovered today by a new generation of electronic music fans that are eager for a change in the status quo of DJs and club parties, thanks to a recent push in released music. In their native Philadelphia, however, the band is well known for playing some of the city's most legendary underground and mainstream venues, as well as hosting their own parties whose acts also emphasize the crossover between live music and DJing.
